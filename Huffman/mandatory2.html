      <h1>IS-211 Mandatory Exercise 2</h1>  
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Learn how to use huffman encoding, which is a very good way of
      compressing text files.</p>
      <p>In addition you will gain some experience with manipulating
      binary trees.</p>
      <h3>Theory</h3>
      <p>The huffman encoding is the optimal compression method if you
      need to encode each character individually. It goes like this:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Count the number of occurences of each character in the text.
      The character and count should be recorded in a Node object.</li>
      <li>Add all nodes to a priority queue, which must be ordered ascending 
        by count</li>
      <li>While the queue contains more than one node:
      <ol>
      <li>Take the two nodes with lowest count off the front of the queue.</li>
       <li>Create a new node, and make the two nodes from the queue its
       children</li>
        <li>Set the count value of the new node to the sum of it's children</li>       
        <li>Add the new node to the queue.</li>
       </ol>
        When there is only a single node left, it is the root of your huffman
        tree.
      </li>
        <li>Traverse the three to find the code for each character. When you
        find a leaf node, the code for the character represented by the
        node can be determined by the path to the node. Going left means a
        zero, and going right represents a one.</li>
        <li>When you have determined the code for a character, you should
        add the character and it's node to a lookup table.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>To encode a text, you get the characters from the text one by one,
        find their code in the lookup table and write the code to the output.</p>
      <p>To decode the text again, you start in the root noe, and read 
        single bits from the encoded text, moving left or right  depending on
        the bit value. When you reach a leaf node, you have read the complete
        code for the node's character, and can write the character to the
        output.</p>
      <h3>Task</h3>
      <p>The accompanying programming project (huffman.zip) contains the
      foundations of an implementation of huffman encoding. The project
      contains three categories of classes:</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>BitSink</dt>
      <dd>BitSinks are objects that can receive single bits (that is ones
      or zeros). They are necessary when you want to write individual bits
      to a file, which you must do when huffman encoding data. If you write
      bits to a FileBitSink, the bits will eventually end up in a file.
      The StringBitSink is similar, except the bits are appended to a string
      of '0' and '1' characters, to make debugging easier.</dd>
      <dt>BitSource</dt>
      <dd>BitSources are the opposite of BitSinks. They allow reading
      single bits from a file (FileBitSource) or a string (StringBitSource)
      </dd>
      <dt>HuffmanCodec</dt>
      <dd>This is just a skeleton. Your task is to complete this class.
      Comments in HuffmanCodec.java, and Main.java will tell you what to do
      .</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>In addition there are a couple of test files: terjevigen.txt contains
      the full text of the poem Terje Vigen, and tv1.txt contains just the
      first line.</p>
